# tetris
I created a Python application usinga TKinter GUI as a version of the classic arcade game, Tetris. Users can control randomly generated blocks using key presses to rotate and reposition blocks, with an objective of avoiding overflow.
Left key to move block left, Right key to move block right, Up to rotate
